The primary opposition was the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), a coalition formed by the Indian National Congress (INC) and many regional parties in 2023. The election was criticised for lack of action on hate speeches by Modi's BJP,[14]Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Lalu Prasad Yadav said of the BJP's ruling chances that \"Modi and Advani can never become the prime minister in their lifetime. Secular forces in this country would never allow the saffron outfit to come to power\". In relation to the INC's Rahul Gandhi he said that Gandhi wants to bring change to the country; he added in relation to Digvijay Singh that he was a \"good man\".[114]Incumbent Prime Minister Narendra Modi was announced as the prime ministerial candidate of the NDA.[65][66] The INDIA bloc announced that the alliance will decide the Prime Minister after the polls.[67][68]The national executive meeting of the BJP held on 16 and 17 January 2023 saw the party reaffirm its faith in Prime Minister Narendra Modi and extend the tenure of BJP national president J. P. Nadda.[114]\n",
            "Charting out the BJP's strategy for the upcoming polls, Modi said in a speech to party workers that they should reach out to every section of society, including the marginalised and minority communities, \"without electoral considerations\".[115]Turnout was 75% in Assam and 84% in Tripura.[205] Assam's INC Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi said that \"there is no Narendra Modi magic in Assam. The Congress has been winning every form of elections since 2001 in Assam, and we are going to repeat the performance this time.\" Additionally, the borders with Bangladesh and Bhutan were closed for security reasons.[206]The 14th Dalai Lama sent a letter congratulating Modi for the BJP's \"decisive victory\". The Dalai Lama expressed hope that just as Modi had brought development and prosperity to Gujarat, India would continue to \"flourish and prosper\" under his leadership.[359][360][361][362]\n",
